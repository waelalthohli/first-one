# Notebooks

This folder contains a ready-to-run Colab notebook to run training examples on TPU or GPU.

How to use

- Open `parallel_recognition_colab.ipynb` in Google Colab.
- (Optional) Mount Google Drive to store checkpoints.
- Select `Runtime -> Change runtime type -> TPU` to enable TPU runtime.
- Run cells in order. The notebook clones the repository and installs required packages.

If you prefer CLI, see the `Colab instructions` file for quick commands.
